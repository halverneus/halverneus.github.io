                                    Nomadic Sound was founded by Nicole Streets:
                                    sound designer, storyteller, and firm
                                    believer that great audio doesn’t just
                                    support a project...it transforms it.
                                    Nicole’s path to sound design started with a
                                    love for music and a curiosity about how
                                    sound shapes emotion, memory, and space. She
                                    brings a unique multidisciplinary approach
                                    that spans technology, leadership, and
                                    creative arts to every project. After
                                    earning a Bachelor of Science in Audio
                                    Production, she launched Nomadic Sound to
                                    bring immersive, emotionally driven sound to
                                    independent creators, wherever their
                                    projects take them.

                    <p>
                        As I reflect on this piece, I get the feeling of brisk,
                        motivated, and purposeful movement. I hear heavy
                        influences of early ‘90s pop synth sound frequently used
                        in workout videos and anime. It has quite a bit of
                        nostalgia to it, so I went with it. It could be used for
                        workout routines and motivational videos. I could also
                        hear it in a video game, with a car race.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The meter of my composition is 4/4, and the tempo is at
                        120bpm. I started with the high hats on the up and down
                        beats and ended each bar with a clap sound as the “open
                        high-hat.” I added the snare to beats 2 and 4, with some
                        syncopation to every 4th bar. To add more syncopation, I
                        put extra kicks and snares in some measures, as well as
                        a snare in the final beat of bar 16, which brings the
                        beat back. I also added percussion sounds and used them
                        to double up the high hats at the beginning of each bar.
                        The bass was derived from the beat of the kick drum, and
                        it followed that rhythm throughout the piece. I then
                        lengthened some of the notes at the end of most bars. It
                        gave it a bit more of a drawn-out feel, which grooves
                        nicely to the harmony.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The first half of this piece is in the key of A minor,
                        and the chord progression I chose is, Am | F | C | G.
                        This progression has a powerful, consonant sound. I then
                        inverted all the chords to sound more even and not jump
                        from one octave to another. I used one chord per bar and
                        repeated the 4 bars until the end of bar 16. For my
                        melody, I went with a motif, giving it a relaxing feel,
                        but also one that expresses movement. The second half of
                        the piece is in the parallel key to A minor, which is A
                        major. For the chord progression, I went with is, A E |
                        D G#dim | Bm | A. I kept the melody as a motif, with
                        different, and longer notes. The tone is still relaxing
                        but has more of a cooldown effect than movement.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Starting at bar 17, using Quick Sampler, I created an
                        original audio sample for my kick track from a sound
                        effect I had recorded for a different project. I then
                        used ES P to manipulate white noise and create original
                        synth sounds for my snare. Continuing to use ES P, I
                        dialed in some square waves for my bass track. I then
                        recorded the sound of a pair of rusted scissors
                        “cutting” to the rhythm of the beat. This added a
                        slightly percussive and ambient sound.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For mixing, I used dynamic processors on every track,
                        but mostly compressors and EQs. First, I placed a
                        compressor on my recorded audio track to level out the
                        highs and lows. I then went in with an EQ on the same
                        track to cut the high frequencies. Next, I went in with
                        some time-based effects. To make the drums and
                        percussion sound fuller, I added a Chroma Reverb effect.
                        I put the same effect on the recorded audio, as it
                        helped it merge better into the mix. Lastly, I added a
                        Stereo Delay effect to the recorded audio to help it
                        carry throughout the song.

                        In mixing and mastering "Will It Stop," I carefully
                        blended a combination of loops, MIDI instruments,
                        recorded sounds, and vocals to create a cohesive
                        industrial dance vibe. I balanced the rhythmic drive of
                        the loops with aggressive, mechanical textures from the
                        MIDI instruments, enhancing their presence through
                        precise EQ and compression. The recorded sounds provided
                        a gritty, tactile quality that added depth to the track,
                        while the vocals, processed with reverb, were carefully
                        placed to cut through the dense instrumental layers. I
                        ensured the overall energy remained intense and dynamic
                        throughout the mastering process. I used multiband
                        compression and limiting to maintain clarity and punch
                        while optimizing the song for various playback systems.

                        For this remix project, I chose Cinderella by Mikaela
                        Davis and Southern Star from the Cambridge library,
                        categorized under psychedelic rock. The original song
                        has a slow groove with a folk/country feel, and I was
                        especially drawn to its mesmerizing, dreamy melodic
                        harps. While listening, I envisioned a way to change the
                        groove, making the percussion bigger and more upfront to
                        give the track a fresh dynamic.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In this variation, I replaced the drums with a more
                        rock-oriented, electric sound. I also changed the groove
                        to double-time in the chorus, adding more energy and
                        drive to that section.

                    <p>
                        In this variation, I recorded and incorporated a live
                        shaker to enhance the double-time groove sections. The
                        added shaker brings a more organic feel to the rhythm,
                        creating a natural, driving pulse that complements the
                        increased energy in these parts. It also adds a subtle
                        dynamic texture, helping to glue the percussion together
                        while maintaining a lively, human touch.

                    <p>
                        Building on the previous two variations, I created
                        ambient wind sounds to add a final touch of natural
                        movement. This element not only enhances the atmosphere
                        but also serves as a subtle cue for the transition into
                        the double-time groove, reinforcing the rhythmic shift
                        and making the change feel more organic and intentional.

                        For this project, I crafted the complete audio
                        experience for a skateboarding video—from custom sound
                        design and an original soundtrack to a signature sonic
                        logo that opens the video with a clear sense of brand
                        identity. The goal was to energize the visuals, enhance
                        storytelling through sound, and create a cohesive,
                        immersive audio environment.

                        To reinforce the Nomadic Sound brand right from the
                        start, I developed a short sonic logo that captures the
                        essence of what we offer: clean, modern, and creatively
                        mobile. I layered tonal swells to suggest movement,
                        using spatial effects and EQ to give the logo clarity
                        and presence. The result is a polished, recognizable
                        sound mark that sets the tone for the video and can be
                        reused across future branded content.
